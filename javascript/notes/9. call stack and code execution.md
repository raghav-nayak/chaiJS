#### Javascript execution context
{} -> Global execution context using `this`
Note: In browser, window object is global execution context

Different execution contextes
1. Global execution context
2. Function execution context
3. Eval execution context

Execution steps
1. Global execution context 
2. "Memory creation phrase" or simply "Creation Phase"
3. Execution phase

```Javascript
let val1 = 10;
let val2 = 20;

function addNum(num1, num2) {
	let total = num1 + num2;
	return total
}

let result1 = addNum(val1, val2);
let result2 = addNum(10, 2);
```

for each call of `addNum`, 
	new variable environment + execution thread
	i.e. memory phase and execution context
	once it gets executed, this is deleted

return value from `addNum` is sent to Global execution context


## call stack
maintains a stack to store all the function calls

LIFO -> Last In First Out
