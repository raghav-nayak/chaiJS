    class React {
        constructor() {

            this.server = "http://localhost:3000";

            document
                .querySelector("button")
                .addEventListener("click", this.handlerClick.bind(this)); // this is bound with button
        }

        handlerClick() {
            console.log("button clicked");
            console.log(this);
            console.log(this.server);
        }
    }

    const app = new React();
</script>
</html>



output:
{
    "library": "React",
    "server": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```



since we are calling this.handleClick and this here is button as console.log(this) gives , so button do not have handleClick access (that's why its coming as undefined ) , so we have to explicit bind this to the class context (Which is React) to get the access.
