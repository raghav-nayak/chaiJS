- specification: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method

fetch()
- starts the process of fetching a resource from the network
- returns a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available
- rejects when a network error is encountered
- does not reject on HTTP errors(404 etc.) 
- a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
- syntax:
	- `fetch(resource)`
	- `fetch(resource, options)`
	- returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object

fetch is handled through micro task queue / priority queue / fetch queue.

It maintains two 
1. onFulfilled[] -> for all successful network calls(both success and error status codes)
2. onRejection[] -> for all unsuccessful network calls
